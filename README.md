# portfolio
<!-- Description -->
For this homework, I created my first portfolio. I created an html page to add the wording and structure. Then, I created a stylesheet to add styling to the webpage. When you click on the links in the nav bar, the UI scrolls to the that specific section on the page. When you click on my first application image, you are taken to the deployed website. When you click on the links in the footer, you are taken to an email application and my personal github page.
